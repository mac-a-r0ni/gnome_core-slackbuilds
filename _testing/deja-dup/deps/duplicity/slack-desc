# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

duplicity:
duplicity: Duplicity backs directories by producing encrypted tar-format volumes
duplicity: and uploading them to a remote or local file server. Because duplicity
duplicity: uses librsync, the incremental archives are space efficient and only
duplicity: record the parts of files that have changed since the last backup.
duplicity: Because duplicity uses GnuPG to encrypt and/or sign these archives,
duplicity: they will be safe from spying and/or modification by the server.
