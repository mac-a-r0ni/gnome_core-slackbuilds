fwupd - A simple daemon to allow session software to update firmware

This project aims to make updating firmware on Linux automatic, safe and
reliable.

Warning: This SlackBuild requires network access when it runs, meaning
it downloads files from the Internet with root access. You should
decide for yourself whether or not you think this is a good idea.
