libbacktrace (library to produce symbolic backtraces)

The libbacktrace library may be linked into a program or library and
used to produce symbolic backtraces. Sample uses would be to print a
detailed backtrace when an error occurs or to gather detailed
profiling information. In general the functions provided by this
library are async-signal-safe, meaning that they may be safely
called from a signal handler.
