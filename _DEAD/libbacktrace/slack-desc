# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libbacktrace:
libbacktrace: The libbacktrace library may be linked into a program or library and
libbacktrace: used to produce symbolic backtraces. Sample uses would be to print a
libbacktrace: detailed backtrace when an error occurs or to gather detailed
libbacktrace: profiling information. In general the functions provided by this
libbacktrace: library are async-signal-safe, meaning that they may be safely
libbacktrace: called from a signal handler.
