Clutter is an open source (LGPL 2.1) software library for creating fast,
compelling, portable, and dynamic graphical user interfaces. It is a 
core part of Gnome3, it is used by the GnomeShell, and is supported by 
the open source community.

Clutter uses OpenGL for rendering (and optionally OpenGL ES for use on 
mobile and embedded platforms), but wraps an easy to use, efficient, 
flexible API around GL's complexity.

Clutter enforces no particular user interface style, but provides a 
rich, generic foundation for higher-level toolkits tailored to specific 
needs.
