# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

umockdev:
umockdev: umockdev mocks Linux devices for creating integration tests for
umockdev: hardware related libraries and programs. It also provides tools to
umockdev: record the properties and behaviour of particular devices, and to run
umockdev: a program or test suite under a test bed with the previously recorded
umockdev: devices loaded. This allows developers of software like gphoto or
umockdev: libmtp to receive these records in bug reports and recreate the
umockdev: problem on their system without having access to the affected HW.
