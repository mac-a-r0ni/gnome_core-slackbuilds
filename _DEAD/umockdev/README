umockdev (Library for Mocking web service API's)

umockdev mocks Linux devices for creating integration tests for
hardware related libraries and programs. It also provides tools to
record the properties and behaviour of particular devices, and to run
a program or test suite under a test bed with the previously recorded
devices loaded. This allows developers of software like gphoto or
libmtp to receive these records in bug reports and recreate the
problem on their system without having access to the affected HW.
