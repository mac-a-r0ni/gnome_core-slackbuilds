libdnet provides a simplified, portable interface to several low-level
networking routines, including:
  * network address manipulation
  * kernel arp(4) cache and route(4) table lookup and manipulation
  * network firewalling (IP filter, ipfw, ipchains, pf, PktFilter, ...)
  * network interface lookup and manipulation
  * IP tunnelling (BSD/Linux tun, Universal TUN/TAP device)
  * raw IP packet and Ethernet frame transmission
