BorgBackup (short: Borg) is a deduplicating backup program.
Optionally, it supports compression and authenticated encryption.

The main goal of Borg is to provide an efficient and secure way to
backup data. The data deduplication technique used makes Borg suitable
for daily backups since only changes are stored. The authenticated
encryption technique makes it suitable for backups to not fully trusted
targets.

Borg is a fork of Attic and is maintained by "The Borg collective".

FIXME:
  Due to outdated version of llfuse here at SBo, building borgbackup
  with mount support using llfuse will fail.

Optional dependencies:
- llfuse is required if you wish to mount an archive using FUSE,
- Sphinx, alabaster, guzzle_sphinx_theme, imagesize, and python3-attrs
  are required if you wish to build the docs (html, man). Please note 
  that the build will fail if Sphinx is installed but the other 
  required packages are not.
