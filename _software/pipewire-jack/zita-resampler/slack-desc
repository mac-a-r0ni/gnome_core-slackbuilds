# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

zita-resampler: Libzita-resampler is a C++ library for resampling audio signals.
zita-resampler: It is designed to be used within a real-time processing context,
zita-resampler: to be fast, and to provide high-quality sample rate conversion.
zita-resampler: The API allows a trade-off between quality and CPU load.
zita-resampler: Even at the highest quality setting libzita-resampler will be
