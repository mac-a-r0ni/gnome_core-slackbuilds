python3-flit_core (Simplified pkging of Python modules, core backend)

Flit is a simple way to put Python packages and modules on PyPI. It
tries to require less thought about packaging and help you avoid
common mistakes.

This provides a PEP 517 build backend for packages using Flit.
The only public interface is the API specified by PEP 517, at
``flit_core.buildapi``.
