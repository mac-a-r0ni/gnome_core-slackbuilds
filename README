These SlackBuilds are what I use to create the liveslak system with GNOME. Many of these are 
the work of others, some are mine. Either way, they are just text files. I find it hard to put 
"copyright" on some text. This isn't a book and these are general build instructions for any distro
but tailored for Slackware systems.

News/blog/packages/repositories are available at my site: https://slackware.lngn.net/
