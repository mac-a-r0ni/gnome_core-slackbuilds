These SlackBuilds are what I use to create the liveslak system with GNOME. Many of these are
the work of others, some are mine. Either way, they are just text files. I find it hard to put
"copyright" on some text. This isn't a book and these are general build instructions for any distro
but tailored for Slackware systems. That said, all of these are copyrighted by thier authors,
so don't go around stealing others work, and removing thier names from it for the fame. There is no
fame, and you'll just be mocked and scolded by the community for being an asshole. ;)
