Epiphany (Web browser from the GNOME desktop)
Web is the web browser for the GNOME desktop and for elementary OS,
based on the popular WebKit engine. It offers a simple, clean,
beautiful view of the web featuring first-class GNOME and Pantheon
desktop integration, a built-in adblocker enabled by default, and
Intelligent Tracking Prevention. With no useless widgets or wasted
space, Web closely follows GNOME's design philosophy. Its code name
is Epiphany.
