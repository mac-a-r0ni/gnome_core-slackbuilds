# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

gnome-text-editor: GNOME Text Editor is a simple text editor that focuses on session
gnome-text-editor: management. It works hard to keep track of changes and state even if
gnome-text-editor: you quit the application. You can come back to your work even if 
gnome-text-editor: you've never saved it to a file.
