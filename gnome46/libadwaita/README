Libadwaita is a GTK4 library implementing the GNOME HIG, complementing
GTK. Libadwaita is the successor of libhandy, but for GTK4.

Among other things, libadwaita provides a set of widgets built on top of
GTK4 as well as the "Adwaita" theme, a coloring API, and a mechanism to
make apps linked against it fit in with a system-wide dark mode
preference.

NOTE:
This version of libadwaita for Slackware 15.0 has been patched to
support GTK 4.4. libadwaita upstream advertises its minimum version as
4.6, although it does not use any C API that is not provided by version
4.4. However, according to the libadwaita git logs, it libadwaita relies
on some fixes from GTK 4.6+ to work 100% correctly.  I have found
libadwaita to work perfectly reasonably with GTK 4.4. Adding one patch
to suppress a CSS runtime warning, the only issue I have run into is
that some fonts may render as larger than the developers have intended,
and window widths and heights are slightly larger as well.

As well, starting with libadwaita 1.2, more GObject properties are
starting to get used that only exist on GTK >= 4.6. I have patched out
one such usage that I have observed. However, continuing to patch
libadwaita will not be maintainable in the long run. For that reason,
libadwaita 1.2.x will be the end of the line for Slackware 15.0.

If you wish to use libadwaita as fully intended by the developers, you
can build a local copy of GTK 4 >= 4.6 on your system.

Build options:

BUILDTYPE => customize build type by setting to a value recognized by
meson; eg, BUILDTYPE=debug (defaults to 'release').

GTK_DOC => set to 'true' to build API documentation; requires
`gi-docgen` (defaults to 'false').
