evince (a simple gtk-based document viewer)

Evince is a document viewer for multiple document formats. It currently 
supports pdf, postscript, djvu, tiff and dvi. The goal of evince is to 
replace the multiple document viewers that exist on the GNOME Desktop 
with a single simple application.

Evince is specifically designed to support the following file formats:
* PDF
* Postscript
* DjVu
* TIFF
* CBR/CBZ (comic books)
* DVI
* XPS (requires optional dependency libgxps)

Note: evince-41.5 is the newest version of evince that is possible
to build on Slackware 15.0. Starting with 42.0, evince requires a
newer poppler than 15.0 has. So please don't ask for this build to
be updated; it'll have to wait for Slackware 15.1.
