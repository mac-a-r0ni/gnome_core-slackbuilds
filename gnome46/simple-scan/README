simple-scan (simple scanning utility)

A really easy way to scan both text and images. You can crop out the
bad parts of an image and rotate it if it is the wrong way round. You
can print your scans, export them to pdf, or save them in a range of
image formats.
This app uses the SANE framework to support most existing scanners.
