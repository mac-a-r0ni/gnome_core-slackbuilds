# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

flatpak: flatpak (Application deployment framework)
flatpak:
flatpak: Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application
flatpak: bundles. Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider
flatpak: system, using containerization techniques such as namespaces to
flatpak: prevent direct access to system resources. Resources from outside the
flatpak: sandbox can be accessed via "portal" services, which are responsible
flatpak: for access control.
