openrc-settingsd (D-Bus services for OpenRC-based systems)

OpenRC-settingsd provides an implementation of the the hostnamed,
localed, and timedated D-Bus services for OpenRC-based systems - in
particular, for typical installations of Gentoo or Slackware Linux.

Once installed, to enable upon boot you must add this to 
/etc/rc.d/rc.local:

# Start openrc-settingsd:
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.openrc-settingsd ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.openrc-settingsd start
fi

and this to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown:

# Stop openrc-settingsd:
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.openrc-settingsd ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.openrc-settingsd stop
fi
