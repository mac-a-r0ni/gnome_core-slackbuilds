Jsonrpc-GLib is a library to communicate with JSON-RPC based peers in
either a synchronous or asynchronous fashion. It also allows
communicating using the GVariant serialization format instead of
JSON when both peers support it. You might want that when
communicating on a single host to avoid parser overhead and
memory-allocator fragmentation.
