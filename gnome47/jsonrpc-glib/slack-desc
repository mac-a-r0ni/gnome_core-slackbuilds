# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

jsonrpc-glib: jsonrpc-glib (a library to communicate using the JSON-RPC 2.0 spec)
jsonrpc-glib:
jsonrpc-glib: Jsonrpc-GLib is a library to communicate with JSON-RPC based peers in
jsonrpc-glib: either a synchronous or asynchronous fashion. It also allows
jsonrpc-glib: communicating using the GVariant serialization format instead of
jsonrpc-glib: JSON when both peers support it. You might want that when
jsonrpc-glib: communicating on a single host to avoid parser overhead and
jsonrpc-glib: memory-allocator fragmentation.
