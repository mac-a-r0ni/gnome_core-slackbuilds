libei is a library for Emulated Input, primarily aimed at the Wayland 
stack. It provides three parts:

 - EI (Emulated Input) for the client side (libei)

 - EIS (Emulated Input Server) for the server side (libeis)

 - oeffis is an optional helper library for DBus communication with the
   XDG RemoteDesktop portal (liboeffis)

The communication between EI and EIS happens over a UNIX socket via a 
custom binary protocol. See the EI protocol documentation for details.
